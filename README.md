## Blackjack Project

+ Week 5 Homework for Skill Distillery

### Overview

+ Use classes to create a functional command line Blackjack game.

### How to play

+ Dealer deals 2 cards to the players and two to himself (1 card face up, the other face down). Blackjack card values: All cards count their face value in blackjack. Picture cards count as 10 and the ace can count as 11. Card suits have no meaning in blackjack. The total of any hand is the sum of the card values in the hand. Players must decide whether to stand(stay) or hit. The dealer acts last and must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 through 21. Players win when their hand totals higher than dealerâ€™s hand, or they have 21 or less when the dealer busts (i.e., exceeds 21).

### Topics/Technologies used

+ Java
+ Enums
+ Object Oriented Classes, Abstract Classes, If and While statements

### Lessons learned

+ First time using Enums. Which is a way for you to create a class with a specific value. Good example is days of the week. Creating a days of the week enums. days of the week wont change, so when creating a new variable you can call days of the week enum and choose one of the seven days.

+ Getting more practices with creating methods and how to call them in different methods. Creating more complex abstractions programs.

+ I struggled when to use abstract classes versus Interfaces and connecting them all at first. Still getting more practice with defining Object oriented programs. I need to practice writing and understanding UML diagrams.
